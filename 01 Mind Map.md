# Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Mind Map

## Central Idea: **Introduction to EMS**

### Branch 1: **EMS Systems Overview**
- **Definition**: Prehospital emergency care and transportation system.
- **Components**:
  - Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD)
  - Emergency Medical Responders (EMR)
  - EMTs
  - Advanced EMTs (AEMT)
  - Paramedics
- **Purpose**: Provide rapid response and hospital-quality care at emergency scenes.

### Branch 2: **Historical Development**
- **1966 National Highway Safety Act**: Assigned the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop EMS standards.
- **French Contribution (1790s)**:
  - First documented EMS for battlefield injuries.
- **Modern EMS**:
  - Integration with public health and research-driven improvements.

### Branch 3: **Levels of EMS Training**
- **EMR**:
  - Activates the EMS system.
  - Provides immediate basic life-saving care.
- **EMT**:
  - Delivers Basic Life Support (BLS).
  - Stabilizes and transports patients.
- **AEMT**:
  - Administers limited medications.
  - Uses advanced airway devices.
- **Paramedic**:
  - Provides Advanced Life Support (ALS).
  - Handles pharmacological and cardiac interventions.

### Branch 4: **Roles and Responsibilities of EMTs**
- **Primary Responsibilities**:
  - Maintain personal health and safety.
  - Ensure patient advocacy.
- **Patient Care**:
  - Perform patient assessment.
  - Provide necessary interventions.
  - Transfer care to higher medical personnel.
- **Scene Safety**:
  - Assess hazards and secure the environment.
  - Coordinate with other responders.

### Branch 5: **Legal and Ethical Considerations**
- **Consent**:
  - Informed Consent.
  - Implied Consent.
- **Medical Oversight**:
  - Standing orders.
  - Online medical direction.
- **Liability and Negligence**:
  - Duty to act.
  - Standard of care.

### Branch 6: **Quality Improvement (QI)**
- **Definition**: Continuous evaluation to improve EMS system effectiveness.
- **EMT's Role**:
  - Maintain accurate documentation.
  - Participate in feedback sessions.
  - Maintain and inspect equipment.

### Branch 7: **Public Health and EMS**
- **Community Role**:
  - Injury prevention programs.
  - Public vaccination campaigns.
- **Public Education**:
  - CPR and first aid training.
- **Data Collection**:
  - Support public health research.

### Branch 8: **EMS Communication Systems**
- **Enhanced 911 (E911)**:
  - Identifies caller location and phone number.
- **Protocols**:
  - Steps for patient care and intervention.
- **Importance of Documentation**:
  - Ensures continuity of care.
  - Serves as legal evidence.

### Branch 9: **Trends and Advances in EMS**
- **Evidence-Based Practice**:
  - Research-driven improvements in EMS protocols.
- **New Technology**:
  - Clotting agents.
  - Enhanced training tools.
- **Mobile Integrated Healthcare (MIH)**:
  - Preventive care and chronic disease management in the community.
