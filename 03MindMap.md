# Lifting and Moving Patients

## 1. Principles of Body Mechanics
- **Definition**: Proper body use to prevent injury while lifting/moving.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Alignment (Head, neck, spine straight)
  - Balance (Wide stance, firm footing)
  - Power Grip (Palms up, full hand grip)
  - Power Lift (Lift with legs, keep weight close)
  - Avoid Twisting (Pivot feet instead)

## 2. Patient Movement Categories
- **Emergency Moves**:
  - Examples:
    - Clothes drag
    - Blanket drag
    - Arm-to-arm drag
- **Urgent Moves**:
  - Example:
    - Rapid extrication with spinal precautions
- **Non-Emergency Moves**:
  - Examples:
    - Direct ground lift
    - Extremity lift
    - Draw-sheet method

## 3. Lifting and Moving Equipment
- **Stretchers**:
  - Wheeled stretcher
  - Portable stretcher
  - Basket stretcher
  - Scoop stretcher
  - Bariatric stretcher
- **Chairs**:
  - Stair chair
  - Stair chair with track-like system
- **Spine Boards**:
  - Long spine board
  - Short spine board
- **Other Tools**:
  - KED (Kendrick Extrication Device)
  - Flexible stretchers

## 4. Patient Positioning
- **Positions**:
  - Supine (For spinal injury)
  - Recovery (Unconscious, non-trauma)
  - Fowler’s/Semi-Fowler’s (Respiratory distress)
  - Shock Position (Elevate legs)
  - Trendelenburg (Declined use)

## 5. Special Considerations
- **Obese Patients**:
  - Use bariatric equipment.
  - Require additional personnel.
- **Pediatric Patients**:
  - Specialized immobilization devices.
- **Elderly Patients**:
  - Handle fragile skin and bones carefully.
- **Combative Patients**:
  - Ensure scene safety, use restraints if needed.

## 6. Team Coordination and Communication
- **Roles**:
  - Team leader
  - Support team members
- **Pre-Move Planning**:
  - Assess environment and patient condition.
- **Communication**:
  - Clear commands (e.g., "Ready, Lift").

## 7. Safety Considerations
- **Scene Safety**:
  - Assess for hazards.
- **Lifting Hazards**:
  - Avoid overloading.
- **Equipment Check**:
  - Ensure functionality of tools.

## 8. Legal and Ethical Responsibilities
- **Consent**:
  - Implied for unconscious patients.
  - Informed for alert patients.
- **Documentation**:
  - Record lift details, equipment used, patient status.

## 9. Practical Scenarios
- **Vehicle Extrication**:
  - Use short spine board, KED.
- **Stairwell Transport**:
  - Use stair chair.
- **Multi-Casualty Incidents**:
  - Triage and prioritize movement.

## 10. Equipment Weight Ratings
- Hydraulic stretchers: Up to 700 lbs.
- Bariatric stretchers: Over 800 lbs.
